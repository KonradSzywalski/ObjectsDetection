This project was divided into two parts: motion detection and object tracking by color. It was made in Python and using The Jupyter Notebook. The skimage library turned out to be useful here. The input files here are previously created recordings in mp4 format. The end result is a recording with outlined edges of the tracked object or area where motion detection was made.
